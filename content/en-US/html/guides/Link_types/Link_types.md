In HTML, link types indicate the relationship between two documents, in which one links to the other using an [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), or [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) element.

| `alternate`                                            | -   If the element is [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) and the `rel` attribute also contains the `stylesheet` type, the link defines an [alternative style sheet](/en-US/docs/Alternative_style_sheets); in that case the `title` attribute must be present and not be the empty string.  -   If the `type` is set to `application/rss+xml` or `application/atom+xml`, the link defines a [syndication feed](/en-US/docs/RSS/Getting_Started/Syndicating). The first one defined on the page is the default.  -   Otherwise, the link defines an alternative page, of one of these types:      -   for another medium, like a handheld device (if the `media` attribute is set)     -   in another language (if the `hreflang` attribute is set),     -   in another format, such as a PDF (if the `type` attribute is set)     -   a combination of these                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)                                                | [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)                                                                                         |
| `archives` __                                          | Defines a hyperlink to a document that contains an archive link to this one. For example, a blog entry could link to a monthly index page this way.      **Note:** Although recognized, the singular `archive` is incorrect and must be avoided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)                                                | [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)                                                                                         |
| `author`                                               | Defines a hyperlink to a page describing the author or providing a way to contact the author.      **Note:** This may be a `mailto:` hyperlink, but this is not recommended on public pages as robot harvesters will quickly lead to a lot of spam sent to the address. In that case, it is better to lead to a page containing a contact form.      Although recognized, the `rev` attribute on [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) or[`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) elements with a link type of `made` is incorrect and should be replaced by the `rel` attribute with this link type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)                                                | [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)                                                                                         |
| `bookmark`                                             | Indicates that the hyperlink is a [permalink](/en-US/docs/Permalink) for the nearest ancestor [`<article>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article) element. If none, it is a permalink for the [section](/en-US/docs/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document) that the element is most closely associated to.

| `icon`                                                 | Defines a resource for representing the page in the user interface, usually an icon (auditory or visual).      If there are multiple `<link rel="icon">`s, the browser uses their `media`, `type`, and `sizes` attributes to select the most appropriate icon. If several icons are equally appropriate, the last one is used. If the most appropriate icon is later found to be inappropriate, for example because it uses an unsupported format, the browser proceeds to the next-most appropriate, and so on.      **Note:** Apple's iOS does not use this link type, nor the `sizes` attribute, like others mobile browsers do, to select a webpage icon for Web Clip or a start-up placeholder. Instead it uses the non-standard [`apple-touch-icon`](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW4) and [`apple-touch-startup-image`](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW6) respectively.      The `shortcut` link type is often seen before `icon`, but this link type is non-conforming, ignored and **web authors must not use it anymore**. | [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)                                                                                                                                        | [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) |

| `noopener`                                             | Instructs the browser to open the link without granting the new browsing context access to the document that opened it — by not setting the [`Window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property on the opened window (it returns `null`).      This is especially useful when opening untrusted links, in order to ensure they cannot tamper with the originating document via the [`Window.opener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property (see [About `rel=noopener`](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) for more details), while still providing the `Referer` HTTP header (unless `noreferrer` is used as well).Note that when `noopener` is used, nonempty target names other than `_top`, `_self`, and `_parent` are all treated like `_blank` in terms of deciding whether to open a new window/tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a), [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area), [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)                                                | [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link)                                                                                         |
