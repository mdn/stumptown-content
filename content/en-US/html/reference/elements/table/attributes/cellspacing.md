# `cellspacing`

This attribute defines the size of the space between two cells in a percentage value or pixels. The attribute is applied both horizontally and vertically, to the space between the top of the table and the cells of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the right of the table and the last column and the
bottom of the table and the last row.

**Do not use this attribute**. The [`<table>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element should be styled using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS).
