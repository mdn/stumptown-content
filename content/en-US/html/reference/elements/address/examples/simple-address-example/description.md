This example demonstrates the use of `<address>` to demarcate the
contact information for an article\'s author.

Although it renders text with the same default styling as the
[`<i>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/i)
or [`<em>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)
elements, it is more appropriate to use `<address>` when dealing with
contact information, as it conveys additional semantic information.
