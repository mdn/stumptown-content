You can style `<input>` elements using various color-related attributes in particular. One unusual one that is specific to text entry-related elements is the CSS [`caret-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color) property, which lets you set the color used to draw the text input caret.

For more information about adding color to elements in HTML, see [Applying color to HTML elements using CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Applying_color).
