To add links to the definitions, you create the link the same way you
always do, with the [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element.

Here we see the definition - now with an `id` attribute,
`"definition-dfn"`, which can be used as the target of a link. Later on,
a link is created using `<a>` with the `href` attribute set to
`"#definition-dfn"` to set up the link back to the definition.
