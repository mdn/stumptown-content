## Short description

[`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements of type **`button`** are rendered as simple push buttons, which can be programmed to control custom functionality anywhere on a webpage as required when assigned an event handler function (typically for the `click` event).

## Description

While `<input>` elements of type `button` are still perfectly valid HTML, the newer [`<button>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) element is now the favored way to create buttons. Given that a [`<button>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)â€™s label text is inserted between the opening and closing tags, you can include HTML in the label, even images.

`<input type="button">` elements have no default behavior (their cousins,`<input type="submit">` and `<input type="reset">` are used to submit and reset forms, respectively). To make buttons do anything, you have to write JavaScript code to do the work.

## Value

An `<input type="button">` elements' `value` attribute contains a [`DOMString`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString) that is used as the button's label.

    <input type="button" value="Click Me">

## Validation

Buttons don't participate in constraint validation; they have no real value to be constrained.
