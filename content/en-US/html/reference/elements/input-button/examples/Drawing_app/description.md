This example shows a very simple drawing app created using a [`<canvas>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) element and some simple CSS and JavaScript. The top two controls allow you to choose the color and size of the drawing pen. The button, when clicked, invokes a function that clears the canvas.
