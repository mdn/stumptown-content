In this example, the [`<div>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) block-level element contains some text. Within that text is a [`<span>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) element, which is an inline element. Because the `<span>` element is inline, the paragraph correctly renders as a single, unbroken text flow.
