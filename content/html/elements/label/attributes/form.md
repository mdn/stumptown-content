# `form`

The [`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
element with which the label is associated (its *form owner*). If
specified, the value of the attribute is the `id` of a
[`<form>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
element in the same document. This lets you place label elements
anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form
elements.
