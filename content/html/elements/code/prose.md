## Short description

The **HTML `<code>` element** displays its contents styled in a fashion
intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer
code. By default, the content text is displayed using the
[user agent's](/en-US/docs/Glossary/user_agent) default monospace font.

## Usage notes

To represent multiple lines of code, wrap the `<code>` element within a
[`<pre>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)
element. The `<code>` element by itself only represents a single phrase
of code or line of code.

A CSS rule can be defined for the `code` selector to override the
browser's default font face. Preferences set by the user might take
precedence over the specified CSS.
