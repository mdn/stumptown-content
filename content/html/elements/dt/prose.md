## Short description

The **HTML `<dt>` element** specifies a term in a description or
definition list, and as such must be used inside a
[`<dl>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl)
element.

## Overview

It is usually followed by a
[`<dd>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd)
element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several
terms that are all defined by the immediate next
[`<dd>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd)
element.

The subsequent
[`<dd>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd)
(**Description Details**) element provides the definition or other
related text associated with the term specified using `<dt>`.
