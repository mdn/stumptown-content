Usage notes
-----------

-   Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code
    snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document,
    but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an
    appendix without affecting the main flow.
-   Being a [sectioning root](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Sectioning_roots),
    the outline of the content of the `<figure>` element is excluded
    from the main outline of the document.
-   A caption can be associated with the `<figure>` element by inserting
    a [`<figcaption>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption)
    inside it (as the first or the last child).
