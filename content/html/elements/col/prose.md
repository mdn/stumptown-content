## Short description

The **HTML `<col>` element** defines a column within a table and is used
for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is generally found
within a [`<colgroup>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup) element.

## Overview

This element allows styling columns using CSS, but only a few properties
will have an effect on the column ([see the CSS 2.1
specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#columns) for a
list).

- CSS properties and pseudo-classes that may be specially useful to
  style the `<col>` element:
  - the
    [`width`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width)
    property to control the width of the column;
  - the
    [`:nth-child`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child)
    pseudo-class to set the alignment on the cells of the column;
  - the
    [`text-align`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align)
    property to align all cells content on the same character
