<!-- <short-description> -->
The **HTML `<embed>` element** embeds external content at the specified
point in the document. This content is provided by an external
application or other source of interactive content such as a browser
plug-in.
<!-- </short-description> -->

<!-- <overview> -->
**Note:** This topic documents only the element that is defined as part
of HTML5. It does not address earlier, non-standardized implementation
of the element.

Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed
support for browser plug-ins, so relying upon `<embed>` is generally not
wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user\'s
browser.
