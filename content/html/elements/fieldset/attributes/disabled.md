# `disabled`

If this attribute is set, all form controls that are
descendants of the `<fieldset>`, are disabled, meaning they are not
editable and won't be submitted along with the `<form>`. They
won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or
focus-related events. By default browsers display such controls
grayed out. Note that form elements inside the
[`<legend>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/legend)
element won't be disabled.
