## Short description

The **HTML `<header>` element** represents introductory content,
typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain
some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name,
and other elements.

## Usage notes

The `<header>` element is not sectioning content and therefore does not
introduce a new section in the
[outline](/en-US/docs/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document). That
said, a `<header>` element is intended to usually contain the
surrounding section's heading (an `h1`--`h6` element), but this is
**not** required.

### Historical Usage

Although the `<header>` element didn't make its way into specifications
until HTML 5, it actually existed at the very beginning of HTML. As seen
in [the very first website](http://info.cern.ch/), it was originally
used as the `<head>` element. At some point, it was decided to use a
different name. This allowed `<header>` to be free to fill a different
role later on.
