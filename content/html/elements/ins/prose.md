## Short description

The **HTML `<ins>` element** represents a range of text that has been
added to a document.

## Overview

You can use the
[`<del>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del)
element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted
from the document.

## Accessibility concerns

The presence of the `ins` element is not announced by most screen
reading technology in its default configuration. It can be made to be
announced by using the CSS [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content)
property, along with the [`::before`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before)
and [`::after`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo-elements.

```css
    ins::before,
    ins::after {
      clip-path: inset(100%);
      clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
      height: 1px;
      overflow: hidden;
      position: absolute;
      white-space: nowrap;
      width: 1px;
    }

    ins::before {
      content: " [insertion start] ";
    }

    ins::after {
      content: " [insertion end] ";
    }
```

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing
content that creates extra verbosity. Because of this, it is important
not to abuse this technique and only apply it in situations where not
knowing content has been inserted would adversely affect understanding.
