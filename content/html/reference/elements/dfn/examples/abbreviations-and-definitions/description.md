In some cases, you may wish to use an abbreviation for a term when
defining it. This can be done by using the `<dfn>` and
[`<abbr>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)
elements together.

The `<abbr>` element is nested inside the `<dfn>`. The former
establishes that the term is an abbreviation ("HST") and specifies the
full term ("Hubble Space Telescope") in its `title` attribute. The
latter indicates that the abbreviated term represents a term being
defined.
