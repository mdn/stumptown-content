## Short description

The **HTML Content Division element** (**`<div>`**) is the generic
container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout
until styled using CSS.

## Overview
As a "pure" container, the `<div>` element does not inherently
represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be
easily styled using the `class` or `id` attributes, marking a section of
a document as being written in a different language (using the `lang`
attribute), and so on.

- The `<div>` element should be used only when no other semantic
  element (such as
  [`<article>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)
  or
  [`<nav>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav))
  is appropriate.
