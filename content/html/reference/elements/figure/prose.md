## Short description

The **HTML `<figure>` element** represents self-contained content,
frequently with a caption
([`<figcaption>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption)),
and is typically referenced as a single unit.

## Usage notes

- Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code
  snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document,
  but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an
  appendix without affecting the main flow.
- Being a [sectioning root](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines#Sectioning_roots),
  the outline of the content of the `<figure>` element is excluded
  from the main outline of the document.
- A caption can be associated with the `<figure>` element by inserting
  a [`<figcaption>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption)
  inside it (as the first or the last child).
