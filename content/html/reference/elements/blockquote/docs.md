## Short description

The **HTML `<blockquote>` Element** (or *HTML Block Quotation Element*)
indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this
is rendered visually by indentation (see [Usage notes](#Usage_notes) for how
to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using
the **cite** attribute, while a text representation of the source can be
given using the
[`<cite>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite)
element.

## Usage notes

To change the indentation applied to the quoted text, use the
[CSS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS")
[`margin-left`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left)
and/or
[`margin-right`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-right)
properties, or the
[`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)
shorthand property.

To include shorter quotes inline rather than in a separate block, use
the
[`<q>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q)
(Quotation) element.
