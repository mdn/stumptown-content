# `novalidate`

This Boolean attribute indicates that the form is not to be
validated when submitted. If this attribute is not specified (and
therefore the form is validated), this default setting can be
overridden by a `formnovalidate` attribute on a
[`<button>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button)
or
[`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
element belonging to the form.
