## Short description

The **HTML Bring Attention To element** (**`<b>`**) is used to draw the
reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise
granted special importance.

## Overview

This was formerly known as the
**Boldface element**, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
However, you should not use `<b>` for styling text; instead, you should
use the CSS
[`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight)
property to create boldface text, or the
[`<strong>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)
element to indicate that text is of special importance.

- Use the `<b>` for cases like keywords in a summary, product names in
  a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be
  boldfaced (but not including any special importance).
- Do not confuse the `<b>` element with the
  [`<strong>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong),
  [`<em>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em),
  or
  [`<mark>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark)
  elements. The
  [`<strong>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)
  element represents text of certain *importance*,
  [`<em>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em)
  puts some emphasis on the text and the
  [`<mark>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark)
  element represents text of certain *relevance*. The `<b>` element
  doesn't convey such special semantic information; use it only when
  no others fit.
- Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the `<b>` element.
  For this purpose, use the
  [`<h1>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h1)
  to
  [`<h6>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/h6)
  tags. Further, stylesheets can change the default style of these
  elements, with the result that they are not *necessarily* displayed
  in bold.
- It is a good practice to use the `class` attribute on the `<b>`
  element in order to convey additional semantic information as needed
  (for example `<b class="lead">` for the first sentence in a
  paragraph). This makes it easier to manage multiple use cases of
  `<b>` if your stylistic needs change, without the need to change all
  of its uses in the HTML.
- Historically, the `<b>` element was meant to make text boldface.
  Styling information has been deprecated since HTML4, so the meaning
  of the `<b>` element has been changed.
- If there is no semantic purpose to using the `<b>` element, you
  should use the CSS
  [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight)
  property with the value `"bold"` instead in order to make text bold.
