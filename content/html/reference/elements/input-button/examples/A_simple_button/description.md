In this example we create a simple button with a `click` event handler that starts our machine.

The script gets a reference to the [`HTMLInputElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) object representing the `<input>` in the DOM, saving this reference in the variable `button`. [`addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) is then used to establish a function that will be run when `click` events occur on the button.
