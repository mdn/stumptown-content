# `value`

This integer attribute indicates the current ordinal value of the
list item as defined by the
[`<ol>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol)
element. The only allowed value for this attribute is a number, even
if the list is displayed with Roman numerals or letters. List items
that follow this one continue numbering from the value set. The
**value** attribute has no meaning for unordered lists
([`<ul>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul))
or for menus
([`<menu>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/menu)).

This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced
in HTML5.
