# `cellpadding`

This attribute defines the space between the content of a cell and its border, displayed or not. If the `cellpadding`'s length is defined in pixels, this pixel-sized space will be applied to all four sides of the cell\'s content. If the length is defined using a percentage value, the content will be centered and the total vertical space (top and bottom) will represent this value. The same is true for the total horizontal space (left and right).

**Do not use this attribute**. The [`<table>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) element should be styled using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS).
