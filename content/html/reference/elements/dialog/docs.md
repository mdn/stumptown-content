## Short description

The **HTML `<dialog>` element** represents a dialog box or other
interactive component, such as an inspector or window.

## Usage notes

- `<form>` elements can be integrated within a dialog by specifying
  them with the attribute `method="dialog"`. When such a form is
  submitted, the dialog is closed with its
  [`returnValue`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/returnValue)
  attribute set to the `value` of the form\'s submit button that was
  used.
- The
  [`::backdrop`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop)
  CSS pseudo-element can be used to style behind a `<dialog>` element,
  for example to dim inaccessible content whilst a modal dialog is
  active. The backdrop is only drawn when the dialog element is
  displayed with
  [`HTMLDialogElement.showModal()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal).
