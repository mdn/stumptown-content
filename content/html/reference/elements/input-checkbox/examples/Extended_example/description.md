The following example is an extended version of the "multiple checkboxes" example we saw above â€” it has more standard options, plus an "other" checkbox that when checked causes a text field to appear to enter a value for the "other" option. This is achieved with a simple block of JavaScript. The example also includes some CSS to improve the styling.
