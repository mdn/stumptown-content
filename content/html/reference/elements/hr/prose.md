## Short description

The **HTML `<hr>` element** represents a thematic break between
paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or
a shift of topic within a section.

## Overview

Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line.
While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers,
this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than
presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you
should do so using appropriate CSS.
