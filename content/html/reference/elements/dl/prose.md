## Short description

The **HTML `<dl>`** element represents a description list. The element
encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the
[`<dt>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dt)
element) and descriptions (provided by
[`<dd>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dd)
elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or
to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).

## Usage notes

Do not use this element (or
[`<ul>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)
elements) to merely create indentation on a page. Although it works,
this is a bad practice and obscures the meaning of description lists.

To change the indentation of a description term, use the
[CSS](/en-US/docs/CSS) [`margin`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin)
property.
