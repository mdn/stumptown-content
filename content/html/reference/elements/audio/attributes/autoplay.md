# `autoplay`

A Boolean attribute: if specified, the audio will automatically
begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the
entire audio file to finish downloading.

**Note**: Sites that automatically play audio (or videos with an
audio track) can be an unpleasant experience for users, so should be
avoided when possible. If you must offer autoplay functionality, you
should make it opt-in (requiring a user to specifically enable it).
However, this can be useful when creating media elements whose
source will be set at a later time, under user control.
