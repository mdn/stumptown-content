# `span`

This attribute contains a positive integer indicating the number of
consecutive columns the `<colgroup>` element spans. If not present,
its default value is `1`.

This attribute is applied on the attributes of the column
group, it has no effect on the CSS styling rules associated with it
or, even more, to the cells of the column's members of the group.

The `span` attribute is not permitted if there are one or more
`<col>` elements within the `<colgroup>`.
