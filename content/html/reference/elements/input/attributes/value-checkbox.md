# `value`

The `value` attribute is one which all [`<input>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)s share; however, it serves a special purpose for inputs of type `checkbox`: when a form is submitted, only checkboxes which are currently checked are submitted to the server, and the reported value is the value of the `value` attribute. If the `value` is not otherwise specified, it is the string `on` by default. This is demonstrated in the section [Value](#Value) above.
